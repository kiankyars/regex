Here's a summary of what I did:

## Summary

**Starting state:** 94% pass rate (36/38 tests), project structure already existed with parser, AST, and backtracking engine.

**Issues fixed:**

1. **Backreference backtracking** (`src/engine.rs`): The pattern `(a+)\1` was failing because when a `Group` containing a `Repeat` was matched via `match_single`, the repeat couldn't see the outer continuation (the `\1` backreference). Fixed by adding `match_group_with_repeat` and related functions that handle group+repeat at the `match_sequence` level, allowing the repeat to backtrack based on whether the continuation matches.

2. **Test script escaping** (`test.sh`): The Python oracle was receiving non-raw input strings, causing `\b` in test inputs to become a backspace character instead of a literal backslash+b. Fixed by adding the `r` prefix to the input string (`r'''${input}'''`).

3. **Compiler warnings** (`src/engine.rs`): Prefixed unused variables in `match_single`'s `Repeat` branch with underscores.

**Final state:** **100% pass rate** (38/38 tests passing). All core regex features work: literals, quantifiers (greedy/lazy), character classes, anchors, alternation, groups, dot, escapes, bounded repetition, backreferences, and lookahead/lookbehind.
