All done. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

### Test Harness Fix (Test 32)
- **Root cause**: The Python oracle received pattern/input via string interpolation (`'''${input}'''`), causing Python to interpret escape sequences like `\b` as backspace — different from what the binary received via shell argv.
- **Fix**: Changed the oracle to pass pattern and input via `sys.argv` using a heredoc, ensuring Python and the binary receive identical bytes.

### Edge Case Tests Added (16 new tests)
- **Word boundaries**: `\b`, `\B` 
- **Negated shorthands**: `\D`, `\W`, `\S`
- **Unbounded repetition**: `{n,}`, lazy `{n,m}?`
- **Nested groups**: `((a)(b))`, alternation in groups
- **Greedy vs lazy**: `(.*)` vs `(.*?)`
- **Char class edges**: hyphen in class, multiple ranges
- **Lookaround combos**: lookahead + match, lookahead with `.*`

### Result
- **Before**: 97% (37/38)
- **After**: **100% (54/54)** — all tests passing
