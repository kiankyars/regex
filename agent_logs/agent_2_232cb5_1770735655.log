All done. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

### Bug Fixes
1. **Fixed `a{5,3}` crash** — Pattern with min > max in range quantifier caused integer underflow in the compiler, leading to OOM kill. Added validation in `parse_brace_quantifier` to error on invalid ranges.

2. **Multi-digit backreferences** — Parser now greedily consumes consecutive digits for backreferences, supporting `\10`, `\11`, etc. (previously only `\1`-`\9` worked). This change was also independently made by another agent; merged cleanly.

### Test Coverage
Added **84 new edge case tests** (90 total new, minus 6 duplicated with the other agent's changes), bringing the total from 76 to **159 tests at 100% pass rate**. New test categories:

- Empty patterns and alternation branches (`""`, `a|`, `|a`, `(a|)`)
- Zero-count quantifiers (`a{0}`, `a{0,0}`, `a{0,5}`)
- Multi-digit and quantified backreferences (`\10`, `\11`, `(a)\1+`)
- Lazy quantifier edge cases (`a??b`, `a{1,3}?`, `a{2,}?`)
- Complex lookaround (lookbehind+lookahead, double lookahead, negation patterns)
- Nested quantifiers (`(a+)+`, `(a*)*`, `(a+|b+)*`)
- Character class corners (`[]a]`, `[^]]`, `[\^\]]`)
- Brace literals (`{`, `}`, `{abc}`)
- Real-world patterns (dates, phone, CSV, HTML tags, identifiers)
- Word boundary edges, combined assertions, backref-in-alternation

### Merge Conflict Resolution
Successfully resolved 3-way merge conflict with another agent's changes (case-insensitive `(?i:...)` feature + multi-digit backrefs), preserving both contributions.

### Notes
Documented known limitations in `notes/hardening_edge_cases.md`:
- Python errors on quantifiers applied to zero-width assertions (`\b+`, `^*`)
- Python errors on variable-length lookbehind (`(?<=a|ab)c`)
