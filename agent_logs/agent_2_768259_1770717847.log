All tasks complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

**Starting state:** 100% pass rate (54/54 tests), all core features implemented.

**What I did:**

1. **Thorough edge case testing** — Manually tested ~40 edge cases against Python's `re` oracle, covering: empty patterns, nested quantifiers, backreference edge cases, character class edge cases, lookaround combinations, Unicode, alternation ordering, zero-width matches, and more. No bugs found — the engine is very solid.

2. **First-character search optimization** (`src/compiler.rs`, `src/vm.rs`):
   - Compiler now extracts `first_char: Option<char>` and `anchored_start: bool` from the bytecode
   - VM `search()` skips starting positions where the first required char doesn't match
   - `^`-anchored patterns only try position 0 (O(1) instead of O(n))

3. **15 new test cases** added to `test.sh`:
   - Quantifier edges (`{0}`, quantified capturing groups)
   - Multi-group backreferences (`(a)(b)\2\1`)
   - Real-world patterns (IP addresses, email-like, hex)
   - Advanced lookaround (word before/after space, lookahead at end)
   - Non-greedy groups, nested captures, non-capturing quantified alternation
   - Boundary cases (empty string with anchors, backslash in char class)

**Final state:** 100% pass rate (69/69 tests). Changes committed and pushed.
